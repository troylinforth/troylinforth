This is a âœ¨ repository âœ¨ full of useful (in my opinion) SDWAN tips and Cisco/Fortinet labs and little things learned at work, in my home lab or while banging my head against an ISR 4451



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Fortinet, Cisco, Huawei, Juniper and Nokia devices.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that Managed Customer Premise Equipment is the bane of my existence.
- ðŸ“’ I'm working on my FCP/FCX Certification & CCNP.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on overthrowing whoever created YAML.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it incorrectly enough.
